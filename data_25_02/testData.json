Medicare anticipates that many of these outpatient studies will not provide the diagnosis within the first 24 hours, but expects that 48 hours of monitoring will be diagnostic in most circumstances. Ambulatory monitoring beyond 48 hours frequently produces poor data in the period after 48 hours, as electrode contact may no longer be optimal after 48 hours. Occasionally, patients may require an additional 48 hour monitoring period to establish a diagnosis, which is usually performed at a later date. Medical necessity must be documented for review in these circumstances. This 48 hour limitation does not apply to the inpatient setting where patients are frequently withdrawn from their anti-epileptic regimens, and where precise pre-surgical localization of epileptic foci is often conducted."

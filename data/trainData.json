CCE utilizes a tiny wireless camera that takes pictures of the gastrointestinal tract. The wireless camera is housed inside a vitamin-size capsule that is swallowed with water. As the capsule travels through the digestive tract, the camera system takes pictures. The images are then transmitted to a computer with special software where the images are strung together to create a video. The provider reviews the video to look for any abnormalities within the gastrointestinal tract."

SCODI also permits high resolution assessment of the retinal and choroidal layers, the presence of thickening associated with retinal edema, and of macular thickness measurement.

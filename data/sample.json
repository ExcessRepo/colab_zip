Causes stem from a wide variety of conditions, although in some cases no specific etiology is identified. Age-related intervertebral disc degeneration, typically resulting in degeneration of the discs themselves, facet joint arthrosis and segmental instability are causative factors. Initial management can include rest, exercise program, avoidance of activities that aggravate pain, application of heat/cold modalities, pharmacotherapy, local injections, lumbar bracing, chiropractic manipulation, and physical therapy. When conservative therapy (non-surgical medical management) is unsuccessful after at least 3 to 12 months, depending on the diagnosis, lumbar spinal fusion may be considered for certain\\n\\nCreated on 10/25/2021.

Surgical techniques to achieve lumbar spinal fusion are numerous, and include different surgical approaches (anterior, posterior, lateral) to the spine, different areas of fusion (intervertebral body (interbody), transverse process (posterolateral), different fusion materials (bone graft and/or metal instrumentation), and a variety of ancillary techniques to augment fusion.

For the majority of the population age 65 or older, pure degenerative disc disease (DDD) without co- morbidities/co-diagnoses is rare and multilevel lumbar fusion in this population is not well studied."

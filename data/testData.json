The capsule device measures pH, temperature, and pressure while traveling through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, sending the data to a wireless receiver worn on or near the patient. The data can be used to determine GI motility, gastric emptying, small bowel transit, colonic transit, and whole gut transit times. The capsule can also provide pressure patterns within the GI tract. The study can be done in a physician office after the patient has discontinued use of all medications that affect the GI tract."

They produce a presynaptic neuromuscular blockade by preventing the release of acetylcholine from the nerve endings. Since the resulting chemical denervation of muscle produces local paresis or paralysis, selected muscles can be treated. The clinical indications for Botulinum toxins have increased exponentially since first used two decades ago. They are used in the treatment of overactive skeletal muscles (e.g. hemifacial spasm, dystonia, spasticity), smooth muscles (e.g. detrusor overactivity and achalasia), glands (e.g. sialorrhoea and hyperhidrosis) and additional conditions that are being investigated."

Each preparation has distinct pharmacological and clinical profiles specified on the product insert. Dosing patterns are also specific to the preparation of neurotoxin and are very different between different serotypes. Failure to recognize the unique characteristics of each formulation of Botulinum toxin can lead to undesired patient outcomes. It is expected that physicians will be familiar with and experienced in the use of these agents, and utilize evidence-based medicine to select the appropriate drug and dose regimen for each patient condition. Physicians may decide which agent to use in beneficiary care except as noted below. Although Botulinum toxins have only been FDA-approved for limited uses, they are frequently used off-label as well. A patient who is not responsive or who ceases to respond to one serotype may respond to the other. "
